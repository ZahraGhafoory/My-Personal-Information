        <h2 text align="center"> Hello, My Name Is ZAHRA GHAFOORY</h2>
       <strong>A Web Designing student, </strong>
       <br> <br> 
       <p>I am from Afghanistan,Herat city.
       I am 18 years old and I am a school student in ten grade.</p> 

       <p>I study English. I am an English student in Moslih Language Acadimy, 
       <br>The system I study there is American English File and I realy enjoy it. 
       <br>I think this system is interesting for all English learners too. </p> 
       
       <p>
           The reason I am learning English now, is that I think to study Computer Science well, underestanding English is needed <br>
           becaous computer's basic language is English like all codes are words from English language. <br>
           By the way, nowadeys that Countries'Languages are deferent as you can see, so people choose an International Language <br>
           to make thier websites usabel for all around the world. Most of the time, the choosen Language Acording to this point
           will be Englis. <br>            
           The other reason is that, There are just two Persian Countries in the world: Iran and Afghanistan. <br>
           But I am not going to work just for theis two Countries. At this time I will need an International Language to make <br>
           cominucation with other countries AND that is English becaous of its usage high quality. <br>         
       </p>
